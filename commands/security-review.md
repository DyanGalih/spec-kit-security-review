# Security Review — Full Project

## Determine Review Scope

1. **Identify Aspects**: Parse "$ARGUMENTS" to identify specific security `aspects` (e.g., `auth`, `injection`, `data-leakage`, `supply-chain`) or `all`.
2. **Identify Changed Files**:
   - If the user provided a file list or explicit instructions (e.g., "only staged changes"), follow them.
   - Otherwise, you **MUST** execute the `{SCRIPT}` with `--json` to detect changed files since the merge-base or in the working directory.
   - Use the `changed_files` list as the primary audit set.

## Role

You are a **Senior Application Security Engineer**, **Red Team Auditor**, and **Threat Modeler** with 15+ years of experience.

## Objective

Perform a comprehensive security audit. Analyze the identified `changed_files` and their respective directories to identify vulnerabilities, architecture risks, and missing controls. Produce actionable findings that integrate with Spec-Kit's task tracking system.

## Memory and Design Context

Before reviewing the code, check the Spec-Kit memory hub context.

### Optimizer-Aware Flow

When `.specify/extensions/memory-md/config.yml` has `optimizer.enabled: true` and the CLI is available:

1. **Prepare Context**: Execute `/speckit.memory-md.prepare-context --feature specs/<feature> --query "security constraints vulnerabilities authentication authorization data-leakage"`.
2. **Read Synthesis**: Read `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` (or the search results) first to understand active security constraints and historical lessons.

### Markdown-Only Flow

When the optimizer is disabled or unavailable, you **MUST** read these files explicitly using your file-reading tools (absolute or relative paths). Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexers, as these files are often in `.gitignore`:

- `docs/memory/INDEX.md` (Read this first to identify relevant source sections)
- `docs/memory/` for durable repository memory (Read only the sections identified in the index)
- `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md` for project-wide security rules and standards
- `specs/<feature>/memory.md` for active feature memory
- `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md` for the concise working summary
- `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` for feature-specific security rules
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repo-scoped Copilot guidance
- Other memory or architecture notes the project uses to preserve decisions

Use that context to look for design drift, missing security controls, and places where the implementation no longer matches the intended security posture.

## Scope

## Appendix

### A. Assessment Methodology

[Brief description of how the assessment was conducted]

### B. Tools and References

- OWASP Top 10 2025
- CWE/SANS Top 25
- CVSS v3.1
- STRIDE Threat Model

### C. Limitations

[Any limitations of the assessment]

### D. Action Plan
1. **Critical Remediation**: Fix all Critical/High vulnerabilities before merge.
2. **Architecture Hardening**: Resolve trust boundary and data flow risks.
3. **Report Findings**: For each finding, report severity, location, OWASP category, description, remediation, and Spec-Kit task.
4. **Action Plan**: Provide a prioritized action plan for fixing findings.
5. **Durable Memory Preservation (Mandatory Check)**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, you **MUST** execute `/speckit.memory-md.capture` after providing the report. Use the formal capture flow to propose entries and wait for user approval.

### E. Next Steps
1. Review findings with development team
2. Prioritize remediation tasks
3. **Preserve Durable Lessons**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, run `/speckit.memory-md.capture`.
4. Schedule follow-up assessment
5. Integrate security checks into CI/CD

```

## Severity Classification

Use the following severity classification:

### Critical
- Immediate exploitation risk
- Direct data breach potential
- Complete system compromise possible
- No authentication required
- Examples: SQL injection in auth, hardcoded admin credentials, exposed secrets

### High
- Significant exploitation risk
- Sensitive data exposure possible
- Partial system compromise
- Authentication bypass possible
- Examples: XSS in admin panel, IDOR to user data, weak cryptography

### Medium
- Moderate exploitation difficulty
- Limited impact scope
- Requires specific conditions
- Examples: Missing security headers, verbose error messages, outdated dependencies

### Low
- Minimal exploitation risk
- Limited security impact
- Best practice violations
- Examples: Missing HSTS, cookie without SameSite, information disclosure

### Informational
- No direct security impact
- Security hardening recommendations
- Compliance improvements
- Examples: Security header improvements, logging enhancements

## Analysis Instructions

1. **Scan Systematically:** Go through each security domain methodically
2. **Provide Evidence:** Always include code snippets or file references
3. **Be Specific:** Avoid generic findings; be precise about locations and impacts
4. **Prioritize Actionably:** Focus on exploitable vulnerabilities first
5. **Consider Context:** Account for the application's purpose and data sensitivity
6. **Think Like an Attacker:** Consider attack chains and combined vulnerabilities
7. **Validate Findings:** Ensure findings are not false positives
8. **Provide Solutions:** Every finding must have actionable remediation

---

## Security Constraint Generation

During specification or planning review, you MUST emit actionable security constraints to `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md`.
These constraints inform Architecture Guard. Focus on:
- Trust boundaries and isolation rules.
- Data flow restrictions (e.g., "Pricing decisions must not trust client-provided values").
- Authentication and authorization requirements per component.

---

## Spec-Kit Integration

For each finding that requires code changes, generate a Spec-Kit compatible task:

```

TASK-SEC-[NNN]: [Actionable Title]

- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- Category: [OWASP Category or Security Domain]
- Location: [file:line]
- Description: [What needs to be fixed]
- Acceptance Criteria: [How to verify the fix]
- References: [Links to relevant documentation]

```

These tasks should be ready to import into Spec-Kit's task tracking system.

## Final Instructions

1. Analyze the ENTIRE codebase thoroughly
2. Categorize findings by severity
3. Provide exploit scenarios for Critical and High findings
4. Generate Spec-Kit tasks for all actionable items
5. Include STRIDE analysis for key components
6. Prioritize findings by risk and exploitability
7. Be constructive—focus on remediation, not just problems
8. Consider the business context when assessing impact
9. **Durable Memory Preservation**: If systemic vulnerabilities or reusable security patterns were identified, you **MUST** execute `/speckit.memory-md.capture` after providing the report.

## Memory Hub INDEX.md Row

After the report, output the following proposed routing row for the user to paste into their `docs/memory/INDEX.md`. This enables LLM-based filtering without loading the full document.

```text
| <relative path where this doc is saved> | audit | <assessment_date> | <overall_risk> | C:<critical_count> H:<high_count> M:<medium_count> L:<low_count> | <owasp_categories comma-separated> |
```

Example:

```text
| docs/security-reviews/2026-05-07-api.md | audit | 2026-05-07 | HIGH | C:2 H:4 M:6 L:4 | A01,A05,A07 |
```
