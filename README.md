## What Is This?

A Spec Kit extension that performs **security reviews at every stage of delivery** — from plan to implementation — and turns findings into structured, trackable remediation tasks.

It answers one question:

> Is this work secure, and if not, what exactly needs to be fixed?

## The Problem It Solves

AI generates code that works, but it doesn't think about security:

- It concatenates user input into SQL queries because that's the fastest path
- It skips authorization checks on admin endpoints because "it's internal"
- It hardcodes API keys in config files because the test passes
- It adds dependencies without checking for known CVEs

You discover these issues in code review — or worse, in production. By then, fixing them is expensive and disruptive.

**Security Review catches these issues early** by reviewing your specs, plans, task lists, staged changes, branch diffs, and full codebase against OWASP 2025, secure coding practices, and your project's own security context.

## What It Actually Does

# Recommended Security Lifecycle

Security Review is a **governance and audit layer** that runs at every phase of Spec Kit delivery to catch vulnerabilities before they reach production.

| Milestone | Recommended Command | Phase Integration | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Milestone: Design** | `security-review.plan` | After `/plan` | Review technical design for trust boundaries and insecure patterns. |
| **Milestone: Strategy** | `security-review.tasks` | After `/tasks` | Ensure security requirements are sequenced correctly in the task list. |
| **Milestone: Verification** | `security-review.audit` | After `/implement` | Full security audit of the final implementation and dependencies. |
| **Milestone: Remediation** | `security-review.apply` | After findings | Inject approved security fixes into your Plan and Task artifacts. |

---

## How to Handle Findings

Security Review generates structured reports with actionable findings. To resolve them:

### 1. Evaluate the Finding
Review the **Exploit Scenario** and **Remediation** provided in the report. Decide if the finding is a valid risk that needs fixing or an accepted project design.

### 2. Plan the Follow-up
Run `/speckit.security-review.followup`.
The AI will guide you through each finding. You can choose to **Fix Now** (add to current tasks) or **Track as Tech Debt** (save for later).

### 3. Apply the Fixes
Run `/speckit.security-review.apply`.
This will **automatically inject** the remediation tasks into your `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, making security part of your standard delivery flow.

---

## Continuous Security (Out-of-Band)

These commands are ideal for pre-commit hooks or automated PR checks to ensure incremental changes remain secure.

| Context | Recommended Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Pre-Commit** | `security-review.staged` | Review only files staged with `git add`. |
| **Pre-Merge** | `security-review.branch` | Review changes introduced by your branch (auto-detects current). |

---

### Key Behavior: Structured, Actionable Output

Every finding includes severity, location, OWASP category, exploit scenario, remediation, and a Spec Kit task ID:

```text
### [CRITICAL] SQL Injection in User Authentication

**Location:** src/auth/login.js:45
**OWASP Category:** A05:2025-Injection
**Description:** User input concatenated directly into SQL query...
**Exploit Scenario:** Attacker could bypass authentication by...
**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries or ORM...
**Spec-Kit Task:** TASK-SEC-001
```

## Benefits

### Compared to Spec Kit Alone

| Spec Kit Only | Spec Kit + Security Review |
| --- | --- |
| Security issues found during code review or production | Caught during planning, before code is written |
| No structured way to track security debt | Every finding becomes a `TASK-SEC-NNN` with severity and acceptance criteria |
| AI generates insecure patterns without feedback | AI output is reviewed against OWASP 2025 and secure coding practices |
| Security is a vague checkbox | Security coverage is enumerated: OWASP, supply chain, secrets, DevSecOps |

### Compared to Traditional Security Tools

| Traditional Tools | Security Review |
| --- | --- |
| Require language-specific scanners per framework | Framework-agnostic, works across any stack |
| Run against code only | Reviews plans, tasks, staged diffs, branch diffs, AND code |
| Produce generic reports | Produces Spec Kit task IDs ready for your backlog |
| Separate workflow from development | Integrated into the Spec Kit delivery lifecycle |
| Expensive to set up and maintain | Zero runtime dependencies, prompt-based |

## Security Coverage

### OWASP Top 10 (2025)

| Code | Category |
| --- | --- |
| A01 | Broken Access Control (includes SSRF) |
| A02 | Security Misconfiguration |
| A03 | Software Supply Chain Failures |
| A04 | Cryptographic Failures |
| A05 | Injection |
| A06 | Insecure Design |
| A07 | Authentication Failures |
| A08 | Software or Data Integrity Failures |
| A09 | Security Logging & Alerting Failures |
| A10 | Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions |

### Additional Coverage

- Input validation and output encoding
- Secrets management and cryptographic handling
- Session and API security
- Trust boundaries and attack surface review
- Dependency, build, and CI/CD risk analysis
- STRIDE threat modeling (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Info Disclosure, DoS, Elevation of Privilege)

## When To Use It

**Use it when:**

- Your project handles **user input, authentication, or sensitive data**
- You're using **AI-assisted development** and want security checks on AI output
- Your team needs **structured security tracking** (not just "we should fix this")
- You want **pre-commit or pre-merge security gates** without blocking tooling
- You need **OWASP coverage** documented for compliance or audit purposes

**Best fit:**

- Web applications and APIs
- Projects with authentication, payments, or user data
- Teams that need security review integrated into their delivery flow
- Codebases with third-party dependencies to monitor

## When NOT To Use It

**Don't use it for:**

- **Static sites with no backend** — there's minimal attack surface
- **Internal scripts with no user input** — no trust boundaries to review
- **Replacing a penetration test** — this is prompt-based review, not runtime testing
- **Replacing dependency scanners** — it checks for known patterns, not CVE databases in real-time
- **Projects with no security requirements** — if security doesn't matter, skip it

**The honest test:** If your project never handles user input, authentication, or sensitive data, you probably don't need this.

## Quick Start

1. Install the extension:
   ```text
   cd /path/to/spec-kit-project
   specify extension add security-review
   ```

2. Run a full audit:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.audit
   ```

3. Turn findings into tasks:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.followup
   ```

4. Apply approved tasks to your plan:
   ```text
   /speckit.security-review.apply
   ```

For day-to-day use, most teams use `staged` before commits and `audit` after implementation.

---

## Commands

### Full Audit

```text
/speckit.security-review.audit
/speckit.security-review.audit focus on authentication, secrets handling, and payment flows
/speckit.security-review.audit review only the api and worker directories
```

The main command. Reviews the entire codebase.

### Staged Changes (Pre-Commit)

```text
/speckit.security-review.staged
/speckit.security-review.staged focus on secrets and injection
```

Reviews only files staged with `git add`. If nothing is staged, it tells you.

### Branch / PR Diff (Pre-Merge)

```text
/speckit.security-review.branch
/speckit.security-review.branch feature/payment-gateway
/speckit.security-review.branch feature/payment-gateway develop
```

Reviews only the code changes introduced by a branch. By default, it detects your **current active branch** and compares it against its **original source** (main, develop, etc.). You can also specify branches explicitly if needed.

### Plan Review

```text
/speckit.security-review.plan
```

Reviews the implementation plan for missing security requirements and unsafe assumptions. Run after `/speckit.plan`.

### Task Review

```text
/speckit.security-review.tasks
```

Checks that security tasks exist and are properly sequenced. Run after `/speckit.tasks`.

### Follow-Up Planning

```text
/speckit.security-review.followup
```

Converts findings into remediation tasks (`Implement now`), technical debt (`Track as technical debt`), or marks them as already covered.

### Apply Follow-Ups

```text
/speckit.security-review.apply
```

Writes approved security tasks into `tasks.md` and `plan.md`. Supports dry-run preview.

## Workflow Integration

```text
/speckit.plan                      → Planning Phase
/speckit.security-review.plan      → Review plan for security gaps
/speckit.tasks                     → Task Generation
/speckit.security-review.tasks     → Review task sequencing
/speckit.implement                 → Implementation Phase
/speckit.security-review.audit     → Full security review
/speckit.security-review.followup  → Convert findings to tasks
/speckit.security-review.apply     → Apply approved tasks
```

### With Companion Extensions

| Extension | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| **Memory Hub** | Security Review reads `docs/memory/`, `specs/<feature>/memory-synthesis.md`, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as design context. Optional but recommended. |
| **Architecture Guard** | Routes architecture-only findings to Architecture Guard. Security Review keeps security findings. No duplication. |

---

## Configuration

Copy `config-template.yml` into your project as a team brief:

```bash
cp config-template.yml speckit-security.yml
```

> **Note:** The extension is prompt-driven and does not read this file automatically. Use it as a human-readable team brief, and include relevant settings in your slash-command input when you want the agent to follow them.

The template covers: exclusion patterns, focus areas, severity thresholds, output settings, OWASP categories, dependency scanning, secrets detection, architecture settings, DevSecOps checks, memory hub paths, reporting, and false positive tracking.
